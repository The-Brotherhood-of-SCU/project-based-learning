# Project-Based Learning Repository

Welcome to the **project-based-learning** repository! This repository is maintained by the Brotherhood of SCU and aims to collect, organize, and share high-quality project-driven learning materials across various domains. Whether you're a student, educator, or self-learner, we hope these resources will help you learn by doing and build practical skills through hands-on projects.

## What is Project-Based Learning?

Project-Based Learning (PBL) is an instructional approach where learners gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge. This repository focuses on curating such resources to facilitate effective PBL experiences.
